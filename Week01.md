## What's IOT, Why?

?> **Definition:** A machine which is able to connect to the internet:
> **In involves**:
>
> - Information Technology
> - Operation Technology
> - Smart Objects
> - Big data
> - Cloud
> - Security
> - Analytics...

### Benefits

Benefits in different domains. For example:

| Domain         | Benefit                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Transportation | - Passenger Security<br />- Route Optimzation<br />- Critical sensing |
| Smart city     | - Connected traffic signals<br />- Parking and lighting<br />- City services |
| Vehicle        | - Wireless router<br />- Connecteed sensors<br />- Urban connectivity |

### Limitations

Data transmission is easy to be accessed by government agencies, data collectors and hackers.

Personal information might get passed to a non-inteded recipent, which will eventually cause security breach

Interconnection between devices makes it much easier for malwares and viruses to spread throughout the whole system.

## Raspberry PI

?> Raspberry Pi is one of many other IoT devices.

Other IOT devices: 

-   Arduino
-   Beagelbone
-   NetBurner
-   Intel Galileo
-   ...

It's a computer, has processor, graphics processor, memory but much smaller than laptop.

Raspberry PI is a general-purpose computer with a linux operating system (**Raspbian**) and the ability to run multiple programs. More complex than [Arduino](#Arduino).

>   Rasbpbian can be easily installed with **NOOBS** (New Out Of the Box Software)

### Device Layer

1.  Sensors and Actuators
2.  Microprocessor chip
3.  Circuit board that houses microprocessor chip (CPU)
4.  Communication methodology to the network (WiFi, Bluetooth)

### Sensors

?> Sensors are used to collect data before transmitted to cloud.

The sensors will keep pumping data to your application, which in turn builds intelligence with that data.

### Different Models

There are **six different models**

-   Pi 2 Model B, Pi 3 Model B and Pi 4 Model B are ideal for beginner projects
-   Modal A+ is powerful for building robotics but doesn't have Ehternet port and only comes with one USB port
-   Pi Zero is a small version of Model A+ but it has more robust computing power.

## Arduino

?> Open source electronics platform which has both hardware and software

Arduino boards

-   are able to read inputs - light sensor, button, Twitter message,...
-   and turn it into output - activating action, turning on LED,...

Is a microcontroller mother board. It's a simple computer that can run one program at a time, over and over again.
